    <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
    <h4>Hi there, my name is Priyamvada Shah.
    </h4>
    I’m a sophomore at Harcourt Butler Technical University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering. My academic journey in the university has consisted of grinding my brains doing <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b>, going towards App Development as suggested by my seniors, then falling back to <b>Web Development</b> since it intrigued me way more! True, we fall back to our likings in the end! This combination of skills allows me to innovate in the website domain and solving real world problems, bridging intricate technological gaps.
    <br>
    I've taken every opportunity that has knocked my door. So far, I've enriched my soft skills using co-curriculars that work well with my interests- be it <b>singing, dramatics, debating</b> and even <b> poetry</b>! With a passion for technology and a versatile skill set that spans multiple domains, I’m well-positioned to make lasting contributions through innovation and teamwork.
